# Running_TROLL
R and bash scripts to be used in conjunction with the TROLL model for smooth initialization of batch jobs.

The most up-to-date version of the TROLL source code with the inclusion of lianas can be found at

The purpose of this repository is to facilitate the easy initialization and running of the TROLL model on the Notre Dame CRC, as well as provide for simple visualization and analysis of model output. The repository is broken into 3 sections:

(1) Initializing TROLL

(2) Running TROLL

(3) Processing Model Output


Intializing TROLL (1) focuses on understanding model paramaterization and generating batches of input files for ensemble or sensitivity analysis.

Running TROLL (2) focuses on submitting a batch of jobs to the CRC queue in an organized and efficient manner from the command line.

Processing model output (3) focuses on moving the output data off the CRC, processing it, and understanding it. Particular attention is given to data visualization and statistical analysis.
